Artist Statement (Xinhua News Agency Interview):
"My hometown is nestled by the Adriatic Sea, where crystal-clear waters kiss the reefs and fishing boats sway gently on the shimmering waves. The ocean is the very inspiration behind my creations. When I witnessed plastic waste defiling the blue waves and oil slicks corroding the corals, I realized deeply that the ocean is not an inexhaustible treasure, but a living being that demands our protection. Every one of my marine paintings captures its grandeur while voicing its fragility."
